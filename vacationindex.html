    <div id="JohnDay">
      <p>You're headed to the sunny John Day fossil beds. There is an abundance of hiking, driving and very old dinosaurs packed in those rocks. Have fun, and make sure to only take what you can carry out on your back! The food will be relatively bland... but you like that, right?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Vancouver">
      <p>You'll have a little spice in your step visiting this Pacific Northwest wonderland. Canadians are a troubled people with a murky past and shifty manner. Don't let that get you down though! Try some of their great eats and look at their big mountains.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Minnesota">
      <p>You're a bit of a masochist, aren't you? The land o' lakes holds plenty of suprises for your chilly proclivities. Minnesota is known as the 'land that everyone forgot' because. Well. Wait.. where was I going with this?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Nola">
      <p>Pack your jorts because you're about to be in for a rocking good time. The party never stops so you may want to bring an extra pair of jorts. You know what? Just bring all your jorts.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="PuertoRico">
      <p>Buenas dias gringo de mierda! That's how the locals addressed me when I visited last year, I think it roughly translates to: "enjoy our island paradise, and may you find all that you seek here." Pretty nice, huh? I thought so too.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Iceland">
      <p>Iceland has a bright history of being a very dark place. The small island nation has lots of geothermal activity, so pack your brightest trunks. The locals have a game of 'catching' tourists and 'throwing' them into the scalding pools. Any reflective material on your trunks will aid in the efforts to rescue you, if you experience this wonderful tradition.</p>
